# Welcome to the Junk-Mart!

This is a place where you can find anything! Well, I am the one to find it. You just ask, I will go back there and try to... Damn, you didn't ask for this pill, did you? I should probably consume it before the inspector comes around... Why is everything purple now?

This game was created as part of the third Bevy Jam: https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3. The theme of the jam is side effects.

# A word of caution

This game (obviously) has no official age rating. Be warned that it might contain the following:

- Dark humor
- Drug and violence references
- Immature humor (#sorry_not_sorry)

## Gameplay

This is a goofy game of memory. Sort of. Orders arrive, and you try to service them by remembering where that stupid little thing is hiding. You just have to click a box. If you guess wrong, get ready for the consequences!
